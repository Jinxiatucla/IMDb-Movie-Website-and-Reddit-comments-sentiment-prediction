I collaborate with Qi Wang in this project. I built the tab and scroll down head, pageB1, page B2 and pageS1. Qi built all input pages. This time we 
did well in collaborating. Our part are independent so that teamwork won't decrease the efficiency. We communicate a lot about how to get details of every records 
in database without adundant work.
